There are only $10^{8}$ `ISGRI` photons per day, so this spectrum is mostly empty. Without changing the essence of the approach, it is more feasible to compare time-tagged events. In this case, it is still necessary to compute per-event response, accounting for all 4 detector variables. This approach extracts the most out of ISGRI data, but is quite computationally expensive. It was exploited in [Mereghetti, Savchenko+ 2020]() for about 1-second long event with very fine time structure. It does not currently appear realistic to apply this method even to day-long observations.\n",
