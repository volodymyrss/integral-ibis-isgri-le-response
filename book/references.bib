  abstract = {A basic component, called Polycell, has been developed for the ISGRI (INTEGRAL Soft Gamma Ray Imager) CdTe camera on board the INTEGRAL (INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory) satellite. Operating at room temperature, it covers the 20 keV-1 MeV energy range. It features a sub-ensemble of 16 CdTe detectors and their associated front end electronics. This electronics is based on 4-channel analog digital ASICs. Their analog part features a low noise preamplifier, allowing a threshold below 20 keV and a pulse rise-time measurement which permits a charge loss correction. The digital part ensures the internal acquisition timing sequence as well as the dialogue with external electronics. Two versions of the ISGRI ASIC have been developed in a collaboration of two CEA microelectronics teams from CEA/DTA/LETI/DSYS and CEA/DSM/DAPNIA/SEI, respectively on a standard CMOS AMS process hardened against radiation by lay-out, and on a Silicon On Insulator process (DMILL MHS), the latter being latch-up free. This paper presents the ASIC and polycell architecture as well as experimental results obtained with polycells equipped with AMS ASICs.},

  abstract = {Polarization of CdTe radiation detectors in the dark was studied theoretically by taking into account a wide set of detector characteristics relevant to the polarization. Drift-diffusion and Poisson's equations were solved numerically in one dimension in time-resolved regime, where the characteristic time is determined by the charging of detector bulk. Shockley-Read-Hall model describes the trapping/detrapping of free carriers. Both diode-like (In,Al)/CdTe/Pt and symmetrical (In,Al,Pt)/CdTe/(In,Al,Pt) detectors were considered. We showed how the space charge is formed in time after detector biasing and a `dead layer' appears in the detector when the accumulated charge screens the bias. Numerical results were compared with the Conventional model of charge accumulation. The influence of temperature on polarization was analyzed and the polarization is correlated with current transient. The approach can be conveniently used to find principal properties of trap levels and contacts in semiconductor radiation detectors.},

The rationale for the irradiation parameters is described. Performance was quantified before and after irradiations by obtaining X-ray spectra with a barium-133 radioactive source and detectors cooled to -20\textdegree C. Energy resolutions, electron and hole drift lengths, and energy calibration parameters were extracted by fitting model spectra to the data. Ten crystals of dimension 10\texttimes 10\texttimes 1~mm3 were used, with two each being irradiated to 20\%, 40\%, 60\%, 80\%, and 100\% of the maximum fluence. Each crystal is pixelized and the eight large pixels of area 9.6mm2 are analysed separately to allow estimation of uncertainties. The main observations are a strong decrease of the electron drift length and an increase of the electronic noise with fluence. The hole drift length shows a tendency to increase with fluence. A basic interpretation of some observations in terms of an increasing density of acceptor trap levels with fluence is given.},

  abstract = {We report on International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) observations of the soft {$\gamma$}-ray repeater SGR 1935+2154 performed between 2020 April 28 and May 3. Several short bursts with fluence of \$\textbackslash sim \{10\}\^\{-7\}\textbackslash mbox\{--\}\{10\}\^\{-6\}\$ erg cm-2 were detected by the Imager on-board INTEGRAL (IBIS) instrument in the 20-200 keV range. The burst with the hardest spectrum, discovered and localized in real time by the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System, was spatially and temporally coincident with a short and very bright radio burst detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and Survey for Transient Astronomical Radio Emission 2 (STARE2) radio telescopes at 400-800 MHz and 1.4 GHz, respectively. Its lightcurve shows three narrow peaks separated by {$\sim$}29 ms time intervals, superimposed on a broad pulse lasting {$\sim$}0.6 s. The brightest peak had a delay of 6.5 {$\pm$} 1.0 ms with respect to the 1.4 GHz radio pulse (that coincides with the second and brightest component seen at lower frequencies). The burst spectrum, an exponentially cutoff power law with photon index \$\{\textbackslash rm\{\textbackslash Gamma \}\}=\{0.7\}\_\{-0.2\}\^\{+0.4\}\$ and peak energy \$\{E\}\_\{p\}=65\textbackslash pm 5\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{keV\}\$ , is harder than those of the bursts usually observed from this and other magnetars. By the analysis of an expanding dust-scattering ring seen in X-rays with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory X-ray Telescope (XRT) instrument, we derived a distance of \$\{4.4\}\_\{-1.3\}\^\{+2.8\}\$ kpc for SGR 1935+2154, independent of its possible association with the supernova remnant G57.2+0.8. At this distance, the burst 20-200 keV fluence of \$(6.1\textbackslash pm 0.3)\textbackslash times \{10\}\^\{-7\}\$ erg cm-2 corresponds to an isotropic emitted energy of \$\textbackslash sim 1.4\textbackslash times \{10\}\^\{39\}\$ erg. This is the first burst with a radio counterpart observed from a soft {$\gamma$}-ray repeater and it strongly supports models based on magnetars that have been proposed for extragalactic fast radio bursts.},

Room temperature stability of the detectors was not good at low operating biases of around 200V. However, it could be improved significantly by operating them at higher biases under full depletion conditions. On the other hand, detectors exhibited excellent stability by cooling them slightly below room temperature down to 0\textdegree C. The effect of this low level of cooling on detector stability was found to be more significant than that of applying high biases at room temperature. By using the detector type presented here, stable operation could be obtained at moderate operating voltages of around 400V and with a modest degree of cooling.},

  abstract = {The detection and quantification of narrow emission lines in X-ray spectra is a challenging statistical task. The Poisson nature of the photon counts leads to local random fluctuations in the observed spectrum that often results in excess emission in a narrow band of energy resembling a weak narrow line. From a formal statistical perspective, this leads to a (sometimes highly) multimodal likelihood. Many standard statistical procedures are based on (asymptotic) Gaussian approximations to the likelihood and simply cannot be used in such settings. Bayesian methods offer a more direct paradigm for accounting for such complicated likelihood functions but even here multimodal likelihoods pose significant computational challenges. The new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods developed in 2008 by van Dyk and Park, however, are able to fully explore the complex posterior distribution of the location of a narrow line, and thus provide valid statistical inference. Even with these computational tools, standard statistical quantities such as means and standard deviations cannot adequately summarize inference and standard testing procedures cannot be used to test for emission lines. In this paper, we use new efficient MCMC algorithms to fit the location of narrow emission lines, we develop new statistical strategies for summarizing highly multimodal distributions and quantifying valid statistical inference, and we extend the method of posterior predictive p-values proposed by Protassov et al. (2002) to test for the presence of narrow emission lines in X-ray spectra. We illustrate and validate our methods using simulation studies and apply them to the Chandra observations of the high redshift quasar PG1634+706.},
